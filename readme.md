## Description for task2

The first test, "AppError contains text," is a unit test because it verifies the rendering and styling of the AppError component in isolation. It doesn't rely on external systems,like system or integration test. It ensures consistent text display with specified font attributes across platforms.

The second test, "AppCategory contains category and iconImage," is a unit test that verifies rendering and structure of AppCategory. It doesn't rely on external systems and components, so it's a unit test. This test validates the presence and properties of an image and label within the AppCategory component.
